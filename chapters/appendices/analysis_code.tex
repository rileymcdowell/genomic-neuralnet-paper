\chapter*{Analysis Code} \label{app:analysis-code}

The source code used to generate the analysis in this paper is available at 
\url{https://github.com/rileymcdowell/genomic-neuralnet}. The \texttt{genomic\_neuralnet}
directory contains the source code itself. The 
\texttt{genomic\_neuralnet/analysis/optimize\_all.sh} script fits all available 
models to all datasets when executed. Command line parameters are available for all python source
code when executed with the \texttt{--help} command line argument. All genomic prediction models presented in this 
paper are implemented in the \texttt{genomic\_neuralnet/methods/} directory. 

To facilitate fitting thousands of model variants on each dataset, Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
resources were utilized for pay by the hour compute capacity. A small compute cluster was 
created containing a single head cluster node and a variable number of slave nodes depending
on the current market price of AWS Elastic Compute Cluster (EC2) instance spot instances at that time.
The head cluster node was initialized with the \texttt{cloud-init-master.sh} script in 
the root source code directory. The slave nodes were initialized
using either the \texttt{cloud-init-slave.sh} or \texttt{cloud-init-slave-gpu.sh} scripts
depending on the absence or presence of a GPU on the node, respectively. All
nodes were running Amazon Linux AMI 2016.03.3 as the base operating system.
