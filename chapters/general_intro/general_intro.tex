\section{Introduction}

Humans have been breeding plants for food since the dawn of agriculture. This process
emerged from a haphazard form of artifical selection where farmers would save seed from the 
highest yielding, healthiest, and easiest to harvest plants to harvest the following year. 
Over thousands of years, this process produced many of the subspecies of plants of  
agricultural value today.

Between 1930 and 1960, academic agricultural and plant breeding communities were setting the
stage for agricultural giants such as Norman Borlaug, Henry A. Wallace, and others explored 
options to breed plants for specific traits, and apply rigorous, scientifically-motivated 
management practices which improve varieties and the yield of agruculture practice worldwide.

As an example, in 1930, corn was an open-pollinated crop with an average 
yield around 20-30 bu/ac. By 1960, field corn had was usually single-cross hybrids 
producing twice the yield of those bred only two or three decades earlier. The implementation
agricultural practices that would drive the green revolution had been kicked off, and
the stage was set for a rapid improvement in yield and genetic gain year-over-year in
corn as well as many other crops. This improvement continued into the 2000s \citep{evenson2003}.

% Common knowledge.
The green revolution drove crop production yields higher through a combination of 
improved agricultural practices and varieties that had greater yield potential
and agronomic stability. By the year 2000, advances in agronomy were slowing, and 
molecular breeding technologies were promising the next advancement in crop yield
through a focus on a better understanding of crop DNA. Bt Corn was commercialized
in 1996 and accounted for 63\% of U.S. grain corn by 2010 \citep{fernandez2012}.

Very recently, the monetary cost of using molecular techniques to measure and even modify plant
genetics artificially has dropped significantly, ushering in an opportunity to inprove 
the rate of genetic gain in plant breeding once again.

% Fehr's Principles of Cultivar Development.
The genetic gain in a breeding program is directly related to a host of factors. A 
general guideline to expected genetic gain each year in a generic inbred breeding 
program is presented in equation \ref{eq:genetic_gain} \citep{fehr1987}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:genetic_gain}
\begin{split}
    G_y           &= \textrm{genetic gain per year} \\
    k             &= \textrm{selection differential} \\
    r             &= \textrm{number of replications} \\
    t             &= \textrm{number of environments} \\
    n             &= \textrm{plants per plot} \\
    \sigma^2_{A}  &= \textrm{additive genetic variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{u}  &= \textrm{within-plot environmental variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{wg} &= \textrm{within-plot genetic variation} \\
    \sigma^2      &= \textrm{between-plot variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{ge} &= \textrm{genotype by environment interaction variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{g}  &= \textrm{genotypic variation} \\
    G_y           &= \frac{k\sigma^2_A}{y \sqrt{ \frac{\frac{\sigma^2_{u} + \sigma^2_{wg}}{n} + \sigma^2}{rt} + \frac{\sigma^2_{ge}}{t} + \sigma^2_{g} }} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The goal of a breeding program is to maximize the total genetic gain per breeding cycle, 
which consists of multiple years of breeding. Controllable ways to improve genetic gain 
per cycle involve increasing the number of replications iand/or environments tested,
increasing the number of plants within each experimental plot, or increasing overall selection pressure
during the breeding year.

Genomic selection allows breeders to grow large cohorts of plants which would ordinarily be 
tested in one location with one or two replications to establish a genetic value and instead 
estimate the genetic value based on previously establised genetic effects.
