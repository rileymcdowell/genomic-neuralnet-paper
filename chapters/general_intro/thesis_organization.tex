\section{Thesis Organization}

This thesis adheres to the Iowa State Journal Paper format. 
Chapter \ref{chp:gen-intro} begins with an introduction to genomic selection and a review of the
genomic selection and prediction literature. Chapter \ref{chp:gen-pred} contains an article to be 
submitted to G3 which evaluates the application of regularized neural network archetectures to six genomic
prediction problems. Chapter \ref{chp:gen-conclusions} outlines the results of the results presented
in Chapter \ref{chp:gen-pred} in the context of genomic prediction and data science literature, with a special
emphasis on potential future work. The thesis ends with a bibliography section and an appendix describing
the location of the raw data and code required to reproduce the results of the study in Chapter \ref{chp:gen-pred}.
