\section{Plant Breeding}

Humans have been breeding plants for food since the dawn of agriculture. This process
emerged from a haphazard form of artifical selection where farmers would save seed from the 
highest yielding, healthiest, and easiest to harvest plants to harvest the following year. 
Over thousands of years, this process produced many of the subspecies of plants we consume today. 

% Wikipedia Green revolution article.
Between 1930 and 1960, the world underwent the 'Green Revolution', when agricultural giants such
as Norman Borlaug, Henry A. Wallace, and many others explored options to breed plants for
specific traits, and apply rigorous, scientifically-motivated management practices to improve
varieties and agruculture practice worldwide.

By 1960, corn had transitioned from an open-pollitaed crop with an average yield around 20-30 bu/ac
to a crop consisting primarily of single-cross hybrids producing twice the yield of those bred 
only two or three decades earlier. The improvement in yield and genetic gain year-over-year in
breeding programs has yet to slow significantly since rigorous hybrid breeding became 
commonplace after 1960.

% Common knowledge.
More recently, the cost of using molecular techniques to measure and even modify plant
genetics artificially has dropped significantly, ushering in an opportunity to inprove 
the rate of genetic gain in plant breeding once again.

\section{Breeder's Equation}

% Fehr's Principles of Cultivar Development.
The genetic gain in a breeding program is directly related to a host of factors. A general guideline
to expected genetic gain 

\begin{equation} \label{gentic_gain}
\begin{split}
    G_y           &= \textrm{genetic gain per year} \\
    k             &= \textrm{selection differential} \\
    r             &= \textrm{number of replications} \\
    t             &= \textrm{number of environments} \\
    n             &= \textrm{plants per plot} \\
    \sigma^2_{A}  &= \textrm{additive genetic variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{u}  &= \textrm{within-plot environmental variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{wg} &= \textrm{within-plot genetic variation} \\
    \sigma^2      &= \textrm{between-plot variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{ge} &= \textrm{genotype by environment interaction variation} \\
    \sigma^2_{g}  &= \textrm{genotypic variation} \\
    G_y           &= \frac{k\sigma^2_A}{y \sqrt{ \frac{\frac{\sigma^2_{u} + \sigma^2_{wg}}{n} + \sigma^2}{rt} + \frac{\sigma^2_{ge}}{t} + \sigma^2_{g} }} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
