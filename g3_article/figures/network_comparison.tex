    \caption{Predictive accuracy ($\mu \pm \sigma_{\bar{x}}$) of 
             regularized and non-regularized 
             neural network models for on benchmark datasets. Only the best performing
             network architecture for each species, trait, and model is included. 
             The accuracy of the best performing model across all folds of data 
             and training cycles were recorded and compared. All pairwise model 
             comparisons within a species and trait were made using a two-sided paired t-test 
             (n=10, paired by training cycle and fold number).
             The resulting p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons within each 
             species and trait combination using the Holm-Bonferroni method. Columns annotated 
             with the same letter are not significantly different 
             at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.}
