    \caption{Time to train identical networks on identical datsets using a dedicated CPU core
             compared to a dedicated GPU card. For all datasets, a single hidden layer, unregularized 
             neural network was trained for 10K epochs. Optimizations that could cause a network
             to terminate training early were disabled so differences in network initialization
             would not affect timing. Each CPU and GPU training example were compared using 
             an independent samples T-test with $n=30$. Columns annotated with the same letter 
             are not significantly different at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.}
